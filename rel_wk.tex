\subsubsection{Deterministic PKE}

The first attempt to define public key security for fully deterministic schemes was by Bellare, Boldyreva, and O'Neill~\cite{BBO07}.
This work formalized a new definition of security that was achievable in the random oracle model as long as the min-entropy
of the plaintext space remained above a certain threshold.  Several other related definitions were proposed shortly after~\cite{BFOR08,BSO08},
producing instantiations in both the random oracle and the standard model, as well as constructions for semantically secure randomized schemes
and randomized key encapsulation mechanisms based on deterministic public key encryption.
Among all of these definitions, two major requirements persist: some restriction on the min-entropy of the plaintexts is always necessary, and
adversary access to the public key must be restricted through multi-phase adversaries. Raghunathan et al.~\cite{RSV13} proposed
a definition that relaxes this second restriction, but changes the adversary's goal to distinguishing between plaintext distributions
rather than individual plaintext queries.  While these deterministic definitions of security provide some insight into what is
required to maintain security in the presence of no randomness, they fail to demonstrate the potential for maintaining some
security when the randomness provided to the scheme is somewhere in between uniform and deterministic.  To answer
this question, hedged encryption schemes present definitions of security and encryption schemes that maintain some
amount of security even in the face of degrading quality randomness.  This is commonly achieved through harvesting randomness
from both the random coins provided to the encryption scheme and the plaintext distribution itself~\cite{BBNRTSSHY2009}.  
Recent work by Bellare and Hoang~\cite{BH15}
has produced standard model constructions for both deterministic and hedged encryption schemes by applying Universal Computational Extractors,
or UCEs~\cite{BHK13}.  This work also demonstrates the continuing utility of lossy trapdoor functions~\cite{PW11}, first applied to deterministic encryption
schemes by Boldyreva et al.~\cite{BSO08}.  Unfortunately, none of these definitions consider the potential for achieving equivalent security to 
semantic security given limited access to randomness, and can be viewed as special cases of nonce-based encryption by varying the
properties of the nonce.

\subsubsection{Password based encryption}

Password-based encryption has been in use for decades, but unfortunately the theoretical underpinnings that demonstrate the
security of common practices have lagged behind.  Several studies of specific password hashing protocols have been produced~\cite{LR88,WG00,Boyen07},
but unfortunately the low entropy of most passwords chosen in practice does not match the assumptions made by these
theoretical analyses in demonstrating security.  More recently, significant effort has been put into developing more general definitions
of security by concretely defining security for key derivation functions.  While the security of general KDFs using common hashing techniques have been
analyzed~\cite{DGHKR04}, the password-based KDF presents particular challenges due to the significantly lower entropy available from
passwords that can be memorized~\cite{Kraw10}.  Password-specific KDF security definitions have focused on defining indistinguishability from
a randomly chosen key~\cite{YY05}, while others have defined security against recovery of the password~\cite{KSHW98,AW05}.  Bellare et al.~\cite{BRT12}
expand on these definitions by developing a multi-instance definition of security for a KDF, which ensures that breaking the
security of a single password does not significantly improve an attacker's ability to learn additional passwords.
Beyond password-based KDFs, password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols allow for two parties in possession of a password
to negotiate a cryptographic session key~\cite{BPR00,GL03,CHKLM05}.  However, the combination of added randomness being locally generated and the interactive
nature of these protocols eliminates many of the security issues associated with the offline dictionary attacks that are the primary concern for
password-based encryption.
